# Tales of Symphonia Character Roster

The world of Tales of Symphonia is quite massive in its scale, with the fact that the world is currently split into two different worlds. Where each are constantly fighting over each world's life source known as Mana, it is what gives life to every living thing. These are the two worlds:

## Sylvarant

Sylvarant is the current declining world that will seize to bring life if the Chosen One doesn't complete the journey around the world. Sylvarant is where we find our main character Lloyd Irving embark on his new adventure with Genis, Colette, Kratos and Raine.

## Tethe'alla

Tethe'alla on the other hand, is the thriving world, constantly having endless amounts of mana to power machinery, and other devices. Like Sylvarant, Tethe'alla also has their own Chosen One who is treated like royalty for the time being until Tethe'alla begins to decline again. Zelos, Sheena, Regal, and Presea reside from Tethe'alla, which Zelos being the current Chosen One.
